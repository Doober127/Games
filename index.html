	        <h2> Daily Life </h2>
	        <p> During Erich Roeger's day many things can happen, at school and at home. These things can be good or bad, fun or boring, or just completly random and insignificant to the day. On the days he doesn't go to school he mainly sits and home and plays video games, hangs out with his friends, or is at a friends house doing something. On days he has school he usally gets all his homework done before going home so he has time to be with friends at home and still makes sure his grades stay at A's and B's. </p>
	        <h3> School </h3>
	        <p> Erich goes to CAIS in Oregon and hopes to learn coding there. His favorite subject is math, which he is a year ahead in, (in 8th grade he is in 9th grade math) but he is not the best at ELA and Social Studies. </p>
